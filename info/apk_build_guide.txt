HOW TO BUILD AN APK FOR YOUR PHONE

Since you want to install the app on your personal device, we can build a Release APK.

1. RUN THE BUILD COMMAND
-----------------------
Open a terminal in the root of your project (ReactNativeTutorial) and run:

cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease

Note: This might take a few minutes as it compiles everything.

2. LOCATE THE APK
----------------
Once the command finishes successfully, your APK will be created at:

android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

3. INSTALL ON YOUR PHONE
-----------------------
You have two options:

Option A: Direct Install (if phone is connected via USB)
Run this command:
npx react-native run-android --mode=release

Option B: Transfer the File
1. Navigate to android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/ on your computer.
2. Send the app-release.apk file to your phone (via USB, Google Drive, WhatsApp, etc.).
3. On your phone, tap the file to install it.

Note: You will likely need to uninstall the development version first if you see an "App not installed" error.
